Card readers are great! They provide most excellent security with a near perfect dance of cryptography, hardware engineering and security by design. In Belgium, most banks have them but currently, after many years of successfully pushing them to nearly all customers, most banks are now encouraging people to using their inferior smartphone apps instead.

**The card reader is Endangered**

## Smartphones are worse than card readers

Smartphones are the biggest computing platform (Android) ever. Because of this popularity it's wise to do your banking on a desktop.

Even wiser to not put all your eggs in a single (desktop/smartphone) basket and use a hardware token (such as the Card Readers shown above) and use that to authenticate your financial transactions.

The card readers work offline. Which is a great boon in an ever changing cybersecurity landscape. If it's online it WILL be attacked.

We know that card readers, which are a form of hardware security tokens, work. [Google demonstrated it years ago by eliminating the phishing attempts of their employees](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/274067-google-eliminated-phishing-by-giving-all-85000-employees-usb-security-keys)

## Banks have ulterior motives to invade your smartphone (privacy)

A hardware card reader doesn't leak your privacy. A smartphone does. It's simple as that. Would you rather live in a world where banks manipulate your behavior using the rich troves of data they collected from your smartphone or in a world where they just aren't capable of doing that (unless buying that data from other, often sketchy, sources).

## Card Readers are beautiful

Card readers demonstrate public private cryptography. It's almost like magic. The tiny device with a keypad that interacts with your bank card offline, allows you to mathemagically prove that you are indeed paying 24,90 EUR to such and such from your very own bank account. All that without a single, wired or wireless, connection. A sort of modern day Math Oracle that blesses your financial transactions. Ain't it beautiful? Almost mystical?
